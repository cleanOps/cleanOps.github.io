No organization with an information technology (IT) infrastructure is immune from attack, but if appropriate policies, processes, and controls are implemented to protect key segments of an organization's computing infrastructure, it might be possible to prevent a breach event from growing to a wholesale compromise of the computing environment.
 
Using this proactive methodology, organizations can enhance their `Active Directory` security posture and protect against incidents that exploit common weaknesses in an Active Directory environment.

**CentralOps** experts conduct a series of onsite workshops in collaboration with key stakeholders from the client organization to:

- Perform data collection using a combination of public and private software

- Analyze data output 

- Evaluate the architecture (on-premise and cloud environments)

- Identify possible attack paths within the Active Directory infrastructure


We will then make recommendations to:ðŸš©

- Harden privileged user access and privileged access management

- Enhance visibility and detection of malicious events within `Active Directory`

- Provide a strategic roadmap to improve the overall `Active Directory` infrastructure
